= Broker configuration parameters

`advertised.listeners`::
*Type:* string +
*Default:* null +
*Importance:* high +
*Dynamic update:* per-broker +
+
Listeners to publish to ZooKeeper for clients to use, if different than the `listeners` config property. In IaaS environments, this may need to be different from the interface to which the broker binds. If this is not set, the value for `listeners` will be used. Unlike `listeners`, it is not valid to advertise the 0.0.0.0 meta-address.
 Also unlike `listeners`, there can be duplicated ports in this property, so that one listener can be configured to advertise another listener's address. This can be useful in some cases where external load balancers are used.

`auto.create.topics.enable`::
*Type:* boolean +
*Default:* true +
*Importance:* high +
*Dynamic update:* read-only +
+
Enable auto creation of topic on the server.

`auto.leader.rebalance.enable`::
*Type:* boolean +
*Default:* true +
*Importance:* high +
*Dynamic update:* read-only +
+
Enables auto leader balancing. A background thread checks the distribution of partition leaders at regular intervals, configurable by `leader.imbalance.check.interval.seconds`. If the leader imbalance exceeds `leader.imbalance.per.broker.percentage`, leader rebalance to the preferred leader for partitions is triggered.

`background.threads`::
*Type:* int +
*Default:* 10 +
*Valid Values:* [1,...] +
*Importance:* high +
*Dynamic update:* cluster-wide +
+
The number of threads to use for various background processing tasks.

`broker.id`::
*Type:* int +
*Default:* -1 +
*Importance:* high +
*Dynamic update:* read-only +
+
The broker id for this server. If unset, a unique broker id will be generated.To avoid conflicts between zookeeper generated broker id's and user configured broker id's, generated broker ids start from reserved.broker.max.id + 1.

`compression.type`::
*Type:* string +
*Default:* producer +
*Importance:* high +
*Dynamic update:* cluster-wide +
+
Specify the final compression type for a given topic. This configuration accepts the standard compression codecs ('gzip', 'snappy', 'lz4', 'zstd'). It additionally accepts 'uncompressed' which is equivalent to no compression; and 'producer' which means retain the original compression codec set by the producer.

`control.plane.listener.name`::
*Type:* string +
*Default:* null +
*Importance:* high +
*Dynamic update:* read-only +
+
Name of listener used for communication between controller and brokers. Broker will use the control.plane.listener.name to locate the endpoint in listeners list, to listen for connections from the controller. For example, if a broker's config is :
listeners = INTERNAL://192.1.1.8:9092, EXTERNAL://10.1.1.5:9093, CONTROLLER://192.1.1.8:9094
listener.security.protocol.map = INTERNAL:PLAINTEXT, EXTERNAL:SSL, CONTROLLER:SSL
control.plane.listener.name = CONTROLLER
On startup, the broker will start listening on "192.1.1.8:9094" with security protocol "SSL".
On controller side, when it discovers a broker's published endpoints through zookeeper, it will use the control.plane.listener.name to find the endpoint, which it will use to establish connection to the broker.
For example, if the broker's published endpoints on zookeeper are :
"endpoints" : ["INTERNAL://broker1.example.com:9092","EXTERNAL://broker1.example.com:9093","CONTROLLER://broker1.example.com:9094"]
 and the controller's config is :
listener.security.protocol.map = INTERNAL:PLAINTEXT, EXTERNAL:SSL, CONTROLLER:SSL
control.plane.listener.name = CONTROLLER
then controller will use "broker1.example.com:9094" with security protocol "SSL" to connect to the broker.
If not explicitly configured, the default value will be null and there will be no dedicated endpoints for controller connections.

`controller.listener.names`::

When used together, min.insync.replicas and acks allow you to enforce greater durability guarantees. A typical scenario would be to create a topic with a replication factor of 3, set min.insync.replicas to 2, and produce with acks of "all". This will ensure that the producer raises an exception if a majority of replicas do not receive a write.

The OAuth/OIDC provider URL from which the provider's https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517#section-5[JWKS (JSON Web Key Set)] can be retrieved. The URL can be HTTP(S)-based or file-based. If the URL is HTTP(S)-based, the JWKS data will be retrieved from the OAuth/OIDC provider via the configured URL on broker startup. All then-current keys will be cached on the broker for incoming requests. If an authentication request is received for a JWT that includes a "kid" header claim value that isn't yet in the cache, the JWKS endpoint will be queried again on demand. However, the broker polls the URL every sasl.oauthbearer.jwks.endpoint.refresh.ms milliseconds to refresh the cache with any forthcoming keys before any JWT requests that include them are received. If the URL is file-based, the broker will load the JWKS file from a configured location on startup. In the event that the JWT includes a "kid" header value that isn't in the JWKS file, the broker will reject the JWT and authentication will fail.

`security.providers`::
*Type:* string +
*Default:* null +
*Importance:* low +
*Dynamic update:* read-only +

`ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm`::
*Type:* string +
*Default:* https +
*Importance:* low +
*Dynamic update:* per-broker +
+
The endpoint identification algorithm to validate server hostname using server certificate.

`ssl.engine.factory.class`::
*Type:* class +
*Default:* null +
*Importance:* low +
*Dynamic update:* per-broker +
+

`ssl.principal.mapping.rules`::
*Type:* string +
*Default:* DEFAULT +
*Importance:* low +
*Dynamic update:* read-only +
+
A list of rules for mapping from distinguished name from the client certificate to short name. The rules are evaluated in order and the first rule that matches a principal name is used to map it to a short name. Any later rules in the list are ignored. By default, distinguished name of the X.500 certificate will be the principal. For more details on the format please see https://kafka.apache.org/23/documentation.html#security_authz[ security authorization and acls]. Note that this configuration is ignored if an extension of KafkaPrincipalBuilder is provided by the `principal.builder.class` configuration.

`ssl.secure.random.implementation`::
*Type:* string +
*Default:* null +
*Importance:* low +
*Dynamic update:* per-broker +
+
The SecureRandom PRNG implementation to use for SSL cryptography operations.

`transaction.abort.timed.out.transaction.cleanup.interval.ms`::
*Type:* int +
*Default:* 10000 (10 seconds) +
*Valid Values:* [1,...] +
*Importance:* low +
*Dynamic update:* read-only +
+
The interval at which to rollback transactions that have timed out.

`transaction.remove.expired.transaction.cleanup.interval.ms`::
*Type:* int +
*Default:* 3600000 (1 hour) +
*Valid Values:* [1,...] +
*Importance:* low +
*Dynamic update:* read-only +
+
The interval at which to remove transactions that have expired due to `transactional.id.expiration.ms` passing.

`zookeeper.ssl.cipher.suites`::
*Type:* list +
*Default:* null +
*Importance:* low +
*Dynamic update:* read-only +
+
Specifies the enabled cipher suites to be used in ZooKeeper TLS negotiation (csv). Overrides any explicit value set via the `zookeeper.ssl.ciphersuites` system property (note the single word "ciphersuites"). The default value of `null` means the list of enabled cipher suites is determined by the Java runtime being used.

`zookeeper.ssl.crl.enable`::
*Type:* boolean +
*Default:* false +
*Importance:* low +
*Dynamic update:* read-only +
+
Specifies whether to enable Certificate Revocation List in the ZooKeeper TLS protocols. Overrides any explicit value set via the `zookeeper.ssl.crl` system property (note the shorter name).

`zookeeper.ssl.enabled.protocols`::
*Type:* list +
*Default:* null +
*Importance:* low +
*Dynamic update:* read-only +
+
Specifies the enabled protocol(s) in ZooKeeper TLS negotiation (csv). Overrides any explicit value set via the `zookeeper.ssl.enabledProtocols` system property (note the camelCase). The default value of `null` means the enabled protocol will be the value of the `zookeeper.ssl.protocol` configuration property.

`zookeeper.ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm`::
*Type:* string +
*Default:* HTTPS +
*Importance:* low +
*Dynamic update:* read-only +
+
Specifies whether to enable hostname verification in the ZooKeeper TLS negotiation process, with (case-insensitively) "https" meaning ZooKeeper hostname verification is enabled and an explicit blank value meaning it is disabled (disabling it is only recommended for testing purposes). An explicit value overrides any "true" or "false" value set via the `zookeeper.ssl.hostnameVerification` system property (note the different name and values; true implies https and false implies blank).

`zookeeper.ssl.ocsp.enable`::
*Type:* boolean +
*Default:* false +
*Importance:* low +
*Dynamic update:* read-only +
+
Specifies whether to enable Online Certificate Status Protocol in the ZooKeeper TLS protocols. Overrides any explicit value set via the `zookeeper.ssl.ocsp` system property (note the shorter name).

`zookeeper.ssl.protocol`::
*Type:* string +
*Default:* TLSv1.2 +
*Importance:* low +
*Dynamic update:* read-only +
+
Specifies the protocol to be used in ZooKeeper TLS negotiation. An explicit value overrides any value set via the same-named `zookeeper.ssl.protocol` system property.
