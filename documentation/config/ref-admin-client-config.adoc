= Admin Client configuration parameters

`bootstrap.servers`::
*Type:* list +
*Importance:* high +
+
A list of host/port pairs to use for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster. The client will make use of all servers irrespective of which servers are specified here for bootstrapping&mdash;this list only impacts the initial hosts used to discover the full set of servers. This list should be in the form `host1:port1,host2:port2,...`. Since these servers are just used for the initial connection to discover the full cluster membership (which may change dynamically), this list need not contain the full set of servers (you may want more than one, though, in case a server is down).

`ssl.key.password`::
*Type:* password +
*Default:* null +
*Importance:* high +
+
The password of the private key in the key store file or the PEM key specified in `ssl.keystore.key'. This is required for clients only if two-way authentication is configured.

`ssl.keystore.certificate.chain`::
*Type:* password +
*Default:* null +
*Importance:* high +
+
Certificate chain in the format specified by 'ssl.keystore.type'. Default SSL engine factory supports only PEM format with a list of X.509 certificates.

`ssl.keystore.key`::
*Type:* password +
*Default:* null +
*Importance:* high +
+
Private key in the format specified by 'ssl.keystore.type'. Default SSL engine factory supports only PEM format with PKCS#8 keys. If the key is encrypted, key password must be specified using 'ssl.key.password'.

`ssl.keystore.location`::
*Type:* string +
*Default:* null +
*Importance:* high +
+
The location of the key store file. This is optional for client and can be used for two-way authentication for client.

`ssl.keystore.password`::
*Type:* password +
*Default:* null +
*Importance:* high +
+
The store password for the key store file. This is optional for client and only needed if 'ssl.keystore.location' is configured. Key store password is not supported for PEM format.

`ssl.truststore.certificates`::
*Type:* password +
*Default:* null +
*Importance:* high +
+
Trusted certificates in the format specified by 'ssl.truststore.type'. Default SSL engine factory supports only PEM format with X.509 certificates.

`ssl.truststore.location`::
*Type:* string +
*Default:* null +
*Importance:* high +
+
The location of the trust store file.

`ssl.truststore.password`::
*Type:* password +
*Default:* null +
*Importance:* high +
+
The password for the trust store file. If a password is not set, trust store file configured will still be used, but integrity checking is disabled. Trust store password is not supported for PEM format.

`client.dns.lookup`::
*Type:* string +
*Default:* use_all_dns_ips +
*Valid Values:* [use_all_dns_ips, resolve_canonical_bootstrap_servers_only] +
*Importance:* medium +
+
Controls how the client uses DNS lookups. If set to `use_all_dns_ips`, connect to each returned IP address in sequence until a successful connection is established. After a disconnection, the next IP is used. Once all IPs have been used once, the client resolves the IP(s) from the hostname again (both the JVM and the OS cache DNS name lookups, however). If set to `resolve_canonical_bootstrap_servers_only`, resolve each bootstrap address into a list of canonical names. After the bootstrap phase, this behaves the same as `use_all_dns_ips`.

`client.id`::
*Type:* string +
*Default:* "" +
*Importance:* medium +
+
An id string to pass to the server when making requests. The purpose of this is to be able to track the source of requests beyond just ip/port by allowing a logical application name to be included in server-side request logging.

`connections.max.idle.ms`::
*Type:* long +
*Default:* 300000 (5 minutes) +
*Importance:* medium +
+
Close idle connections after the number of milliseconds specified by this config.

+
Specifies the timeout (in milliseconds) for client APIs. This configuration is used as the default timeout for all client operations that do not specify a `timeout` parameter.

`receive.buffer.bytes`::
*Type:* int +
*Default:* 65536 (64 kibibytes) +
*Valid Values:* [-1,...] +
*Importance:* medium +
+
The size of the TCP receive buffer (SO_RCVBUF) to use when reading data. If the value is -1, the OS default will be used.

*Type:* int +
*Default:* 30000 (30 seconds) +
*Valid Values:* [0,...] +
*Importance:* medium +
+
The configuration controls the maximum amount of time the client will wait for the response of a request. If the response is not received before the timeout elapses the client will resend the request if necessary or fail the request if retries are exhausted.

`sasl.client.callback.handler.class`::
*Type:* class +
*Default:* null +
*Importance:* medium +
+
The fully qualified name of a SASL client callback handler class that implements the AuthenticateCallbackHandler interface.

`sasl.jaas.config`::
*Type:* password +
*Default:* null +

JAAS configuration file format is described http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jgss/tutorials/LoginConfigFile.html[here]. The format for the value is: `loginModuleClass controlFlag (optionName=optionValue)*;`. For brokers, the config must be prefixed with listener prefix and SASL mechanism name in lower-case. For example, listener.name.sasl_ssl.scram-sha-256.sasl.jaas.config=com.example.ScramLoginModule required;.

`sasl.login.callback.handler.class`::
*Type:* class +
*Default:* null +
*Importance:* medium +
+
The fully qualified name of a SASL login callback handler class that implements the AuthenticateCallbackHandler interface. For brokers, login callback handler config must be prefixed with listener prefix and SASL mechanism name in lower-case. For example, listener.name.sasl_ssl.scram-sha-256.sasl.login.callback.handler.class=com.example.CustomScramLoginCallbackHandler.

`sasl.login.class`::
*Type:* class +

`sasl.oauthbearer.jwks.endpoint.url`::
*Type:* string +
*Default:* null +
*Importance:* medium +
+
The OAuth/OIDC provider URL from which the provider's https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517#section-5[JWKS (JSON Web Key Set)] can be retrieved. The URL can be HTTP(S)-based or file-based. If the URL is HTTP(S)-based, the JWKS data will be retrieved from the OAuth/OIDC provider via the configured URL on broker startup. All then-current keys will be cached on the broker for incoming requests. If an authentication request is received for a JWT that includes a "kid" header claim value that isn't yet in the cache, the JWKS endpoint will be queried again on demand. However, the broker polls the URL every sasl.oauthbearer.jwks.endpoint.refresh.ms milliseconds to refresh the cache with any forthcoming keys before any JWT requests that include them are received. If the URL is file-based, the broker will load the JWKS file from a configured location on startup. In the event that the JWT includes a "kid" header value that isn't in the JWKS file, the broker will reject the JWT and authentication will fail.

`sasl.oauthbearer.token.endpoint.url`::
*Type:* string +
*Default:* null +
*Importance:* medium +
+
The URL for the OAuth/OIDC identity provider. If the URL is HTTP(S)-based, it is the issuer's token endpoint URL to which requests will be made to login based on the configuration in sasl.jaas.config. If the URL is file-based, it specifies a file containing an access token (in JWT serialized form) issued by the OAuth/OIDC identity provider to use for authorization.

`security.protocol`::
*Type:* string +
*Default:* PLAINTEXT +
*Importance:* medium +
+
Protocol used to communicate with brokers. Valid values are: PLAINTEXT, SSL, SASL_PLAINTEXT, SASL_SSL.

`send.buffer.bytes`::

*Default:* 131072 (128 kibibytes) +
*Valid Values:* [-1,...] +
*Importance:* medium +
+
The size of the TCP send buffer (SO_SNDBUF) to use when sending data. If the value is -1, the OS default will be used.

`socket.connection.setup.timeout.max.ms`::
*Type:* long +
*Default:* 30000 (30 seconds) +
*Importance:* medium +
+
The maximum amount of time the client will wait for the socket connection to be established. The connection setup timeout will increase exponentially for each consecutive connection failure up to this maximum. To avoid connection storms, a randomization factor of 0.2 will be applied to the timeout resulting in a random range between 20% below and 20% above the computed value.

`socket.connection.setup.timeout.ms`::
*Type:* long +
*Default:* 10000 (10 seconds) +
*Importance:* medium +
+
The amount of time the client will wait for the socket connection to be established. If the connection is not built before the timeout elapses, clients will close the socket channel.

`ssl.enabled.protocols`::
*Type:* list +
*Default:* TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3 +
*Importance:* medium +
+
The list of protocols enabled for SSL connections. The default is 'TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3' when running with Java 11 or newer, 'TLSv1.2' otherwise. With the default value for Java 11, clients and servers will prefer TLSv1.3 if both support it and fallback to TLSv1.2 otherwise (assuming both support at least TLSv1.2). This default should be fine for most cases. Also see the config documentation for `ssl.protocol`.

`ssl.keystore.type`::
*Type:* string +
*Default:* JKS +
*Importance:* medium +
+
The file format of the key store file. This is optional for client.

`ssl.protocol`::
*Type:* string +
*Default:* TLSv1.3 +
*Importance:* medium +
+
The SSL protocol used to generate the SSLContext. The default is 'TLSv1.3' when running with Java 11 or newer, 'TLSv1.2' otherwise. This value should be fine for most use cases. Allowed values in recent JVMs are 'TLSv1.2' and 'TLSv1.3'. 'TLS', 'TLSv1.1', 'SSL', 'SSLv2' and 'SSLv3' may be supported in older JVMs, but their usage is discouraged due to known security vulnerabilities. With the default value for this config and 'ssl.enabled.protocols', clients will downgrade to 'TLSv1.2' if the server does not support 'TLSv1.3'. If this config is set to 'TLSv1.2', clients will not use 'TLSv1.3' even if it is one of the values in ssl.enabled.protocols and the server only supports 'TLSv1.3'.

`ssl.provider`::
*Type:* string +
*Default:* null +
*Importance:* medium +
+

*Default:* 1000 (1 second) +
*Valid Values:* [0,...] +
*Importance:* low +
+
The maximum amount of time in milliseconds to wait when reconnecting to a broker that has repeatedly failed to connect. If provided, the backoff per host will increase exponentially for each consecutive connection failure, up to this maximum. After calculating the backoff increase, 20% random jitter is added to avoid connection storms.

`reconnect.backoff.ms`::
*Type:* long +
*Default:* 50 +
*Valid Values:* [0,...] +

*Default:* 2147483647 +
*Valid Values:* [0,...,2147483647] +
*Importance:* low +
+
Setting a value greater than zero will cause the client to resend any request that fails with a potentially transient error. It is recommended to set the value to either zero or `MAX_VALUE` and use corresponding timeout parameters to control how long a client should retry a request.

`retry.backoff.ms`::
*Type:* long +
*Default:* 100 +
*Valid Values:* [0,...] +
*Importance:* low +
+
