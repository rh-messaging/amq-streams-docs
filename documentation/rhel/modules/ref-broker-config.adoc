= Broker configuration parameters

`zookeeper.connect`::
*Type:* string +
*Importance:* high +
*Dynamic update:* read-only +
+
Specifies the ZooKeeper connection string in the form `hostname:port` where host and port are the host and port of a ZooKeeper server. To allow connecting through other ZooKeeper nodes when that ZooKeeper machine is down you can also specify multiple hosts in the form `hostname1:port1,hostname2:port2,hostname3:port3`.
The server can also have a ZooKeeper chroot path as part of its ZooKeeper connection string which puts its data under some path in the global ZooKeeper namespace. For example to give a chroot path of `/chroot/path` you would give the connection string as `hostname1:port1,hostname2:port2,hostname3:port3/chroot/path`.

`advertised.host.name`::
*Type:* string +
*Default:* null +
*Importance:* high +
*Dynamic update:* read-only +
+
DEPRECATED: only used when `advertised.listeners` or `listeners` are not set. Use `advertised.listeners` instead.
Hostname to publish to ZooKeeper for clients to use. In IaaS environments, this may need to be different from the interface to which the broker binds. If this is not set, it will use the value for `host.name` if configured. Otherwise it will use the value returned from java.net.InetAddress.getCanonicalHostName().

`advertised.listeners`::
*Type:* string +
*Default:* null +
*Importance:* high +
*Dynamic update:* per-broker +
+
Listeners to publish to ZooKeeper for clients to use, if different than the `listeners` config property. In IaaS environments, this may need to be different from the interface to which the broker binds. If this is not set, the value for `listeners` will be used. Unlike `listeners` it is not valid to advertise the 0.0.0.0 meta-address.

`advertised.port`::
*Type:* int +
*Default:* null +
*Importance:* high +
*Dynamic update:* read-only +
+
DEPRECATED: only used when `advertised.listeners` or `listeners` are not set. Use `advertised.listeners` instead.
The port to publish to ZooKeeper for clients to use. In IaaS environments, this may need to be different from the port to which the broker binds. If this is not set, it will publish the same port that the broker binds to.

`auto.create.topics.enable`::

*Importance:* high +
*Dynamic update:* read-only +
+
Enable auto creation of topic on the server.

`compression.type`::
*Type:* string +
*Default:* producer +
*Importance:* high +
*Dynamic update:* cluster-wide +
+
Specify the final compression type for a given topic. This configuration accepts the standard compression codecs ('gzip', 'snappy', 'lz4', 'zstd'). It additionally accepts 'uncompressed' which is equivalent to no compression; and 'producer' which means retain the original compression codec set by the producer.

`control.plane.listener.name`::
*Type:* string +
*Default:* null +
*Importance:* high +
*Dynamic update:* read-only +
+
Name of listener used for communication between controller and brokers. Broker will use the control.plane.listener.name to locate the endpoint in listeners list, to listen for connections from the controller. For example, if a broker's config is :
listeners = INTERNAL://192.1.1.8:9092, EXTERNAL://10.1.1.5:9093, CONTROLLER://192.1.1.8:9094
listener.security.protocol.map = INTERNAL:PLAINTEXT, EXTERNAL:SSL, CONTROLLER:SSL
control.plane.listener.name = CONTROLLER
On startup, the broker will start listening on "192.1.1.8:9094" with security protocol "SSL".
On controller side, when it discovers a broker's published endpoints through ZooKeeper, it will use the control.plane.listener.name to find the endpoint, which it will use to establish connection to the broker.
For example, if the broker's published endpoints on ZooKeeper are :
"endpoints" : ["INTERNAL://broker1.example.com:9092","EXTERNAL://broker1.example.com:9093","CONTROLLER://broker1.example.com:9094"]
 and the controller's config is :
listener.security.protocol.map = INTERNAL:PLAINTEXT, EXTERNAL:SSL, CONTROLLER:SSL
control.plane.listener.name = CONTROLLER
then controller will use "broker1.example.com:9094" with security protocol "SSL" to connect to the broker.
If not explicitly configured, the default value will be null and there will be no dedicated endpoints for controller connections.

`delete.topic.enable`::
*Type:* boolean +

If this minimum cannot be met, then the producer will raise an exception (either NotEnoughReplicas or NotEnoughReplicasAfterAppend).
When used together, min.insync.replicas and acks allow you to enforce greater durability guarantees. A typical scenario would be to create a topic with a replication factor of 3, set min.insync.replicas to 2, and produce with acks of "all". This will ensure that the producer raises an exception if a majority of replicas do not receive a write.

`kafka.metrics.reporters`::
*Type:* list +
*Default:* "" +
*Importance:* low +
*Dynamic update:* read-only +
+
A list of classes to use as Yammer metrics custom reporters. The reporters should implement `kafka.metrics.KafkaMetricsReporter` trait. If a client wants to expose JMX operations on a custom reporter, the custom reporter needs to additionally implement an MBean trait that extends `kafka.metrics.KafkaMetricsReporterMBean` trait so that the registered MBean is compliant with the standard MBean convention.

`listener.security.protocol.map`::
*Type:* string +
*Default:* PLAINTEXT:PLAINTEXT,SSL:SSL,SASL_PLAINTEXT:SASL_PLAINTEXT,SASL_SSL:SASL_SSL +
*Importance:* low +
*Dynamic update:* per-broker +
+
Map between listener names and security protocols. This must be defined for the same security protocol to be usable in more than one port or IP. For example, internal and external traffic can be separated even if SSL is required for both. Concretely, the user could define listeners with names INTERNAL and EXTERNAL and this property as: `INTERNAL:SSL,EXTERNAL:SSL`. As shown, key and value are separated by a colon and map entries are separated by commas. Each listener name should only appear once in the map. Different security (SSL and SASL) settings can be configured for each listener by adding a normalised prefix (the listener name is lowercased) to the config name. For example, to set a different keystore for the INTERNAL listener, a config with name `listener.name.internal.ssl.keystore.location` would be set. If the config for the listener name is not set, the config will fallback to the generic config (i.e. `ssl.keystore.location`).

`log.message.downconversion.enable`::
*Type:* boolean +
*Default:* true +
*Importance:* low +
*Dynamic update:* cluster-wide +
+
This configuration controls whether down-conversion of message formats is enabled to satisfy consume requests. When set to `false`, broker will not perform down-conversion for consumers expecting an older message format. The broker responds with `UNSUPPORTED_VERSION` error for consume requests from such older clients. This configurationdoes not apply to any message format conversion that might be required for replication to followers.

`metric.reporters`::
*Type:* list +
*Default:* "" +
*Importance:* low +
*Dynamic update:* cluster-wide +
