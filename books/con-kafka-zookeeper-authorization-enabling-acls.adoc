= ACL Configuration

Enforcement of ACL rules is controlled by the `zookeeper.set.acl` property in the `config/server.properties` Kafka configuration file and is disabled by default.
To enabled the ACL protection set `zookeeper.set.acl` to `true`:

[source]
----
zookeeper.set.acl=true
----

Kafka will set the ACL rules only for newly created Zookeeper `znodes`.
When the ACLs are only enabled after the first start of the cluster, the tool `zookeeper-security-migration.sh` can be used to set ACLs on all existing `znodes`.

The data stored in Zookeeper includes information such as topic names and their configuration.
The Zookeeper database also contains the salted and hashed user credentials when SASL SCRAM authentication is used.
But it does not include any records sent and received using Kafka.
Kafka, in general, considers the data stored in Zookeeper as non-confidential.
In case these data are considered confidential (for example because topic names contain customer identification) the only way how to protect them is by isolating Zookeeper on the network level and allowing access only to Kafka brokers.
