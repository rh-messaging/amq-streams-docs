= Consumer configuration parameters

`key.deserializer`::
*Type:* class +
*Importance:* high +
+
Deserializer class for key that implements the `org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Deserializer` interface.

`value.deserializer`::
*Type:* class +
*Importance:* high +
+
Deserializer class for value that implements the `org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Deserializer` interface.

`bootstrap.servers`::
*Type:* list +
*Default:* "" +
*Valid Values:* non-null string +
*Importance:* high +
+
A list of host/port pairs to use for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster. The client will make use of all servers irrespective of which servers are specified here for bootstrapping&mdash;this list only impacts the initial hosts used to discover the full set of servers. This list should be in the form `host1:port1,host2:port2,...`. Since these servers are just used for the initial connection to discover the full cluster membership (which may change dynamically), this list need not contain the full set of servers (you may want more than one, though, in case a server is down).

`fetch.min.bytes`::
*Type:* int +
*Default:* 1 +
*Valid Values:* [0,...] +
*Importance:* high +
+
The minimum amount of data the server should return for a fetch request. If insufficient data is available the request will wait for that much data to accumulate before answering the request. The default setting of 1 byte means that fetch requests are answered as soon as a single byte of data is available or the fetch request times out waiting for data to arrive. Setting this to something greater than 1 will cause the server to wait for larger amounts of data to accumulate which can improve server throughput a bit at the cost of some additional latency.

`group.id`::
*Type:* string +
*Default:* null +
*Importance:* high +
+
A unique string that identifies the consumer group this consumer belongs to. This property is required if the consumer uses either the group management functionality by using `subscribe(topic)` or the Kafka-based offset management strategy.

`heartbeat.interval.ms`::
*Type:* int +
*Default:* 3000 +
*Importance:* high +
+
The expected time between heartbeats to the consumer coordinator when using Kafka's group management facilities. Heartbeats are used to ensure that the consumer's session stays active and to facilitate rebalancing when new consumers join or leave the group. The value must be set lower than `session.timeout.ms`, but typically should be set no higher than 1/3 of that value. It can be adjusted even lower to control the expected time for normal rebalances.

`max.partition.fetch.bytes`::
*Type:* int +
*Default:* 1048576 +
*Valid Values:* [0,...] +
*Importance:* high +
+
The maximum amount of data per-partition the server will return. Records are fetched in batches by the consumer. If the first record batch in the first non-empty partition of the fetch is larger than this limit, the batch will still be returned to ensure that the consumer can make progress. The maximum record batch size accepted by the broker is defined via `message.max.bytes` (broker config) or `max.message.bytes` (topic config). See fetch.max.bytes for limiting the consumer request size.

`session.timeout.ms`::
*Type:* int +
*Default:* 10000 +
*Importance:* high +
+
The timeout used to detect consumer failures when using Kafka's group management facility. The consumer sends periodic heartbeats to indicate its liveness to the broker. If no heartbeats are received by the broker before the expiration of this session timeout, then the broker will remove this consumer from the group and initiate a rebalance. Note that the value must be in the allowable range as configured in the broker configuration by `group.min.session.timeout.ms` and `group.max.session.timeout.ms`.

`ssl.key.password`::
*Type:* password +
*Default:* null +
*Importance:* high +
+
The password of the private key in the key store file. This is optional for client.

`ssl.keystore.location`::
*Type:* string +
*Default:* null +
*Importance:* high +
+
The location of the key store file. This is optional for client and can be used for two-way authentication for client.

`ssl.keystore.password`::
*Type:* password +
*Default:* null +
*Importance:* high +
+
The store password for the key store file. This is optional for client and only needed if ssl.keystore.location is configured.

`ssl.truststore.location`::
*Type:* string +
*Default:* null +
*Importance:* high +
+
The location of the trust store file.

`ssl.truststore.password`::
*Type:* password +
*Default:* null +
*Importance:* high +
+
The password for the trust store file. If a password is not set access to the truststore is still available, but integrity checking is disabled.

`allow.auto.create.topics`::
*Type:* boolean +
*Default:* true +
*Importance:* medium +
+
Allow automatic topic creation on the broker when subscribing to or assigning a topic. A topic being subscribed to will be automatically created only if the broker allows for it using `auto.create.topics.enable` broker configuration. This configuration must be set to `false` when using brokers older than 0.11.0.

`auto.offset.reset`::
*Type:* string +
*Default:* latest +
*Valid Values:* [latest, earliest, none] +
*Importance:* medium +
+
What to do when there is no initial offset in Kafka or if the current offset does not exist any more on the server (e.g. because that data has been deleted): 

* earliest: automatically reset the offset to the earliest offset
* latest: automatically reset the offset to the latest offset
* none: throw exception to the consumer if no previous offset is found for the consumer's group
* anything else: throw exception to the consumer.

`client.dns.lookup`::
*Type:* string +
*Default:* default +
*Valid Values:* [default, use_all_dns_ips, resolve_canonical_bootstrap_servers_only] +
*Importance:* medium +
+

+
Controls how the client uses DNS lookups.
+
If set to `use_all_dns_ips` then, when the lookup returns multiple IP addresses for a hostname, they will all be attempted to connect to before failing the connection. Applies to both bootstrap and advertised servers.
+
If the value is `resolve_canonical_bootstrap_servers_only` each entry will be resolved and expanded into a list of canonical names.


`connections.max.idle.ms`::
*Type:* long +
*Default:* 540000 +
*Importance:* medium +
+
Close idle connections after the number of milliseconds specified by this config.

`default.api.timeout.ms`::
*Type:* int +
*Default:* 60000 +
*Valid Values:* [0,...] +
*Importance:* medium +
+
Specifies the timeout (in milliseconds) for consumer APIs that could block. This configuration is used as the default timeout for all consumer operations that do not explicitly accept a `timeout` parameter.

`enable.auto.commit`::
*Type:* boolean +
*Default:* true +
*Importance:* medium +
+
If true the consumer's offset will be periodically committed in the background.

`exclude.internal.topics`::
*Type:* boolean +
*Default:* true +
*Importance:* medium +
+
Whether internal topics matching a subscribed pattern should be excluded from the subscription. It is always possible to explicitly subscribe to an internal topic.

`fetch.max.bytes`::
*Type:* int +
*Default:* 52428800 +
*Valid Values:* [0,...] +
*Importance:* medium +
+
The maximum amount of data the server should return for a fetch request. Records are fetched in batches by the consumer, and if the first record batch in the first non-empty partition of the fetch is larger than this value, the record batch will still be returned to ensure that the consumer can make progress. As such, this is not a absolute maximum. The maximum record batch size accepted by the broker is defined via `message.max.bytes` (broker config) or `max.message.bytes` (topic config). Note that the consumer performs multiple fetches in parallel.

`group.instance.id`::
*Type:* string +
*Default:* null +
*Importance:* medium +
+
A unique identifier of the consumer instance provided by end user. Only non-empty strings are permitted. If set, the consumer is treated as a static member, which means that only one instance with this ID is allowed in the consumer group at any time. This can be used in combination with a larger session timeout to avoid group rebalances caused by transient unavailability (e.g. process restarts). If not set, the consumer will join the group as a dynamic member, which is the traditional behavior.

`isolation.level`::
*Type:* string +
*Default:* read_uncommitted +
*Valid Values:* [read_committed, read_uncommitted] +
*Importance:* medium +
+

+
Controls how to read messages written transactionally. If set to `read_committed`, consumer.poll() will only return transactional messages which have been committed. If set to `read_uncommitted`' (the default), consumer.poll() will return all messages, even transactional messages which have been aborted. Non-transactional messages will be returned unconditionally in either mode.
+
Messages will always be returned in offset order. Hence, in  `read_committed` mode, consumer.poll() will only return messages up to the last stable offset (LSO), which is the one less than the offset of the first open transaction. In particular any messages appearing after messages belonging to ongoing transactions will be withheld until the relevant transaction has been completed. As a result, `read_committed` consumers will not be able to read up to the high watermark when there are in flight transactions.
+
 Further, when in `read_committed` the seekToEnd method will return the LSO.

`max.poll.interval.ms`::
*Type:* int +
*Default:* 300000 +
*Valid Values:* [1,...] +
*Importance:* medium +
+
The maximum delay between invocations of poll() when using consumer group management. This places an upper bound on the amount of time that the consumer can be idle before fetching more records. If poll() is not called before expiration of this timeout, then the consumer is considered failed and the group will rebalance in order to reassign the partitions to another member.

`max.poll.records`::
*Type:* int +
*Default:* 500 +
*Valid Values:* [1,...] +
*Importance:* medium +
+
The maximum number of records returned in a single call to poll().

`partition.assignment.strategy`::
*Type:* list +
*Default:* class org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.RangeAssignor +
*Valid Values:* non-null string +
*Importance:* medium +
+
The class name of the partition assignment strategy that the client will use to distribute partition ownership amongst consumer instances when group management is used.

`receive.buffer.bytes`::
*Type:* int +
*Default:* 65536 +
*Valid Values:* [-1,...] +
*Importance:* medium +
+
The size of the TCP receive buffer (SO_RCVBUF) to use when reading data. If the value is -1, the OS default will be used.

`request.timeout.ms`::
*Type:* int +
*Default:* 30000 +
*Valid Values:* [0,...] +
*Importance:* medium +
+
The configuration controls the maximum amount of time the client will wait for the response of a request. If the response is not received before the timeout elapses the client will resend the request if necessary or fail the request if retries are exhausted.

`sasl.client.callback.handler.class`::
*Type:* class +
*Default:* null +
*Importance:* medium +
+
The fully qualified name of a SASL client callback handler class that implements the AuthenticateCallbackHandler interface.

`sasl.login.callback.handler.class`::
*Type:* class +
*Default:* null +
*Importance:* medium +
+
The fully qualified name of a SASL login callback handler class that implements the AuthenticateCallbackHandler interface. For brokers, login callback handler config must be prefixed with listener prefix and SASL mechanism name in lower-case. For example, listener.name.sasl_ssl.scram-sha-256.sasl.login.callback.handler.class=com.example.CustomScramLoginCallbackHandler.

`sasl.login.class`::
*Type:* class +
*Default:* null +
*Importance:* medium +
+
The fully qualified name of a class that implements the Login interface. For brokers, login config must be prefixed with listener prefix and SASL mechanism name in lower-case. For example, listener.name.sasl_ssl.scram-sha-256.sasl.login.class=com.example.CustomScramLogin.

`reconnect.backoff.ms`::
*Type:* long +
*Default:* 50 +
*Valid Values:* [0,...] +
*Importance:* low +
+

If a refresh would otherwise occur closer to expiration than the number of buffer seconds then the refresh will be moved up to maintain as much of the buffer time as possible. Legal values are between 0 and 3600 (1 hour); a default value of  300 (5 minutes) is used if no value is specified. This value and sasl.login.refresh.min.period.seconds are both ignored if their sum exceeds the remaining lifetime of a credential. Currently applies only to OAUTHBEARER.

`sasl.login.refresh.min.period.seconds`::
*Type:* short +
*Default:* 60 +
