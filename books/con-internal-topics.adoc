= Internal topics

Internal topics are created and used internally by the Kafka brokers and clients.
Kafka has several internal topics.
These are used to store consumer offsets (`\__consumer_offsets`) or transaction state (`__transaction_state`).
These topics can be configured using dedicated Kafka broker configuration options starting with prefix `offsets.topic.` and `transaction.state.log.`. 
The most important configuration options are:

`offsets.topic.replication.factor`::
Number of replicas for `__consumer_offsets` topic.
The default value is `3`.

`offsets.topic.num.partitions`::
Number of partitions for `__consumer_offsets` topic.
The default value is `50`.

`transaction.state.log.replication.factor`::
Number of replicas for `__transaction_state` topic.
The default value is `3`.

`transaction.state.log.num.partitions`::
Number of partitions for `__transaction_state` topic.
The default value is `50`.

`transaction.state.log.min.isr`::
Minimum number of replicas that must acknowledge a write to `__transaction_state` topic to be considered successful.
If this minimum cannot be met, then the producer will fail with an exception.
The default value is `2`.
