= JAAS Configuration

SASL authentication for Zookeeper connections has to be configured in the JAAS configuration file.
By default, Kafka will use the JAAS context named `Client` for connecting to Zookeeper.
The `Client` context should be configured in the `/opt/kafka/config/jass.conf` file.
The context has to enable the `PLAIN` SASL authentication, as in the following example:

[source]
----
Client {
    org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule required
    username="kafka"
    password="123456";
};
----
