= Topic auto-creation

When a producer or consumer tries to sent to or received from from a topic which does not exist, Kafka will, by default, automatically create that topic. 
This behavior is controlled by the `auto.create.topics.enable` configuration property which is set to `true` by default.

To disable it, set `auto.create.topics.enable` to `false` in the Kafka broker configuration file:
