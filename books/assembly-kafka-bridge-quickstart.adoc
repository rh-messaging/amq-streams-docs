= Kafka Bridge quickstart

:context: kafka-bridge-quickstart

Use this quickstart to try out the {ProductName} Kafka Bridge on {ProductPlatformName}. You will learn how to:

* Install the Kafka Bridge
* Produce messages to topics and partitions in your Kafka cluster
* Create a Kafka Bridge consumer
* Perform basic consumer operations, such as subscribing the consumer to topics and retrieving the messages that you produced

In this quickstart, HTTP requests are formatted as curl commands that you can copy and paste to your terminal.

Ensure you have the prerequisites and then follow the tasks in the order provided in this chapter.

.About data formats

In this quickstart, you will produce and consume messages in JSON format, not binary. For more information on the data formats and HTTP headers used in the example requests, see xref:con-requests-kafka-bridge-kafka-bridge-overview[].
