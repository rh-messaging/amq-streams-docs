= Configuring AMQ Streams

.Prerequisites

* AMQ Streams is downloaded and installed on the host

.Procedure

. Open Zookeeper and Kafka broker configuration files in a text editor. 
The configuration files are located at :
+
Zookeeper:: `/opt/kafka/config/zookeeper.properties`
Kafka:: `/opt/kafka/config/server.properties`

. Edit the configuration options.
The configuration files are in the Java properties format.
Every configuration option should be on separate line in the following format:
+
[source,subs=+quotes]
_<option>_ = _<value>_
+
Lines starting with `#` or `!` will be treated as comments and will be ignored by AMQ Streams components.
+
[source,subs=+quotes]
# This is a comment
+
Values can be split into multiple lines by using `\` directly before the newline / carriage return.
+
[source,subs=+quotes]
sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule required \
    username="bob" \
    password="bobs-password";

. Save the changes

. Restart the Zookeeper or Kafka broker

. Repeat this procedure on all the nodes of the cluster.
