= Enabling {Zookeeper} ACLs for a new Kafka cluster

This procedure describes how to enable {Zookeeper} ACLs in Kafka configuration for a new Kafka cluster.
Use this procedure only before the first start of the Kafka cluster.
For enabling {Zookeeper} ACLs in a cluster that is already running, see xref:proc-kafka-migrating-zookeeper-acls-{context}[].

.Prerequisites

* AMQ Streams is xref:proc-installing-amq-streams-{context}[installed] on all hosts which will be used as Kafka brokers.
* {Zookeeper} cluster is xref:proc-running-multinode-zookeeper-cluster-{context}[configured and running].
* Client-to-server authentication is xref:proc-zookeeper-enable-client-to-server-auth-digest-md5-{context}[enabled] in {Zookeeper}.
* {Zookeeper} authentication is xref:proc-kafka-enable-zookeeper-auth-{context}[enabled] in the Kafka brokers.
* Kafka brokers have not yet been started.

.Procedure

. Edit the `/opt/kafka/config/server.properties` Kafka configuration file to set the `zookeeper.set.acl` field to `true` on all cluster nodes.
