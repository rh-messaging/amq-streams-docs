This procedure describes how to enable Zookeeper ACLs in Kafka configuration for a new Kafka cluster.
Use this procedure only before the first start of the Kafka cluster.
For enabling Zookeeper ACLs in already running cluster, see xref:proc-kafka-migrating-zookeeper-acls-{context}[].

.Prerequisites

* AMQ Streams is xref:proc-installing-amq-streams-{context}[installed] on all hosts which will be used as Kafka brokers.
* Zookeeper cluster is xref:proc-running-multinode-zookeeper-cluster-{context}[configured and running].
* Client-to-server authentication is xref:proc-zookeeper-enable-client-to-server-auth-digest-md5-{context}[enabled] in Zookeeper.
* Zookeeper authentication is xref:proc-kafka-enable-zookeeper-auth-{context}[enabled] in the Kafka brokers.
* Kafka broker have not yet been started.
