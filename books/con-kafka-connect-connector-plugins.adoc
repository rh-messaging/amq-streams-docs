= Connector plugins

AMQ Streams ships with two connetor plugins:

`FileStreamSink`:: 
Reads data from Kafka topics and writes them into a file.

`FileStreamSource`::
Reads data from a file and sends them to Kafka topic.

You can add and use additional connector plugins.
Kafka Connect will load all plugins which it finds during startup.
The path where it will search for plugins can be defined using the `plugin.path` configuration option.
The `plugin.path` configuration option can contain a comma-separated list of paths.

[source,ini]
----
plugin.path=/opt/kafka/connector-plugins,/opt/connectors

When running Kafka Connect in distributed mode, the plugins have to be available on all worker nodes.
