= Topic deletion

Kafka offers the possibility to disable deletion of topics.
This is configured through the `delete.topic.enable` property, which is set to `true` by default (that is, deleting topics is possible).
When this property is set to `false` it will be not possible to delete topics and all attempts to delete topic will return success but the topic will not be deleted.
