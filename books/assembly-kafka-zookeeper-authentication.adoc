= Zookeeper authentication

By default, connections between Zookeeper and Kafka are not authenticated.
However, Kafka and Zookeeper support Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) which can be used to set up authentication using Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL).
Zookeeper supports authentication using the DIGEST-MD5 SASL mechanism with locally stored credentials.
