= Commit logs

Apache Kafka stores all records it receives from producers in commit logs.
The commit logs contain the actual data, in the form of records, that Kafka needs to deliver. 
These are not the application log files which record what the broker is doing.

.Log directories

You can configure log directories using the `log.dirs` property filed to store commit logs in one or multiple log directories.
It should be set to `/var/lib/zookeeper` directory created during installation:

[source]
----
log.dirs=/var/lib/zookeeper
----

For performance reasons, you can configure log.dirs to multiple directories and place each of them on a different physical device to improve disk I/O performance.
For example:

[source]
----
log.dirs=/var/lib/zookeeper1,/var/lib/zookeeper2,/var/lib/zookeeper3
----
