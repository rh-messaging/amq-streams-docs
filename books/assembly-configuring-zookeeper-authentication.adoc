= Authentication

By default, {Zookeeper} does not use any form of authentication and allows anonymous connections.
However, it supports Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) which can be used to set up  authentication using Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL).
{Zookeeper} supports authentication using the DIGEST-MD5 SASL mechanism with locally stored credentials.
