= Distributed tracing

{ProductName} on {ProductPlatformName} supports distributed tracing for:

* Kafka Producers, Kafka Consumers, and Kafka Streams applications (referred to as _Kafka Clients_)

* MirrorMaker and Kafka Connect

* Kafka Bridge

The steps to configure distributed tracing vary by client and component; however, three high-level tasks are involved:

. Enabling a Jaeger tracer

. Enabling the Interceptors for the client or component

. Setting tracing environment variables before deployment

//How you configure distributed tracing varies depending on the client or component involved.

//.Kafka clients (Kafka Producers, Kafka Consumers, and Kafka Streams applications)

//You instrument Kafka clients for distributed tracing using an OpenTracing client library. This involves adding instrumentation code that monitors the execution of individual transactions in order to generate trace data.

//Before you start instrumenting Kafka clients and components, you must first initialize and configure a Jaeger tracer in each client and component. This is described in xref:proc-configuring-jaeger-tracer-kafka-clients-{context}[].

NOTE: Distributed tracing is not supported for Kafka brokers.

//.Outline of procedures

//To set up distributed tracing for {ProductName}, follow these procedures:

//* xref:proc-configuring-jaeger-tracer-kafka-clients-{context}[Initialize a Jaeger tracer for Kafka clients and components]

//* xref:proc-instrumenting-producers-consumers-for-opentracing-{context}[Instrument Kafka Producers and Consumers for tracing]

//* xref:proc-instrumenting-kafka-streams-with-tracers-{context}[Instrument Kafka Streams applications for tracing]

//* xref:proc-instrumenting-mirror-maker-connect-bridge-for-tracing-{context}[Instrument Mirror Maker, Kafka Connect, and the Kafka Bridge for tracing]

//* xref:proc-enabling-tracing-for-kafka-bridge-{context}[Enable tracing for the Kafka Bridge] 

This chapter covers setting up distributed tracing for {ProductName} clients and components only. Setting up distributed tracing for applications and systems beyond {ProductName} is outside the scope of this chapter. To learn more about this subject, see the {OpenTracingDocs} and search for "inject and extract".

.Before you start

Before you set up distributed tracing for {ProductName}, it is helpful to understand:

* The basics of OpenTracing, including key concepts such as traces, spans, and tracers. Refer to the {OpenTracingDocs}.
* The components of the {JaegerArch}. 

.Prerequisites

* The Jaeger backend components are deployed to the host operating system. For deployment instructions, see the https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.14/deployment/[Jaeger deployment documentation^].
