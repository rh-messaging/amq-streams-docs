= Requests to the Kafka Bridge

== Authentication and encryption

Authentication and encryption between HTTP clients and the Kafka Bridge is not yet supported. This means that requests sent from clients to the Kafka Bridge are:

* Not encrypted, and must use HTTP rather than HTTPS

* Sent without authentication

You can configure xref:assembly-kafka-encryption-and-authentication-str[TLS or SASL-based authentication] between the Kafka Bridge and your Kafka cluster.

You configure the Kafka Bridge for authentication through its xref:proc-configuring-kafka-bridge-{context}[properties file].

== Data formats and headers

Specify data formats and HTTP headers to ensure valid requests are submitted to the Kafka Bridge.

API request and response bodies are always encoded as JSON.

=== Content Type headers

A `Content-Type` header must be submitted for all requests (apart from the exception described below). 

Consumer operations (`/consumers` endpoints) and producer operations (`/topics` endpoints) require different `Content-Type` headers.  

.Content-Type headers for consumer operations

Regardless of the link:#embedded-data-format[embedded data format], `POST` requests for consumer operations must provide the following `Content-Type` header if the request body contains data: 

[source,http,subs=+quotes]
----
Content-Type: application/vnd.kafka.v2+json
----

Do not send a `Content-Type` header if the `POST` request body is empty, or the request will fail.

.Content-Type headers for producer operations

When performing producer operations, `POST` requests must provide the following `Content-Type` header specifying the desired __embedded data format__, either `json` or `binary`, as shown in the following table.

[%autowidth,cols="2*",options="header",stripes="none",separator=¦]
|===

¦Embedded data format
¦Content-Type header

¦JSON
m¦Content-Type: application/vnd.kafka.json.v2+json

¦Binary
m¦Content-Type: application/vnd.kafka.binary.v2+json

|===

You set the embedded data format when creating a consumer using the `consumers/groupid` endpoint--for more information, see the next section.

The `Content-Type` must not be set if the `POST` request has an empty body. An empty body can be used to create a consumer with the default values.

[#embedded-data-format]
=== Embedded data format

The embedded data format is the format of the Kafka messages that are transmitted, over HTTP, from a producer to a consumer using the Kafka Bridge. Two embedded data formats are supported: JSON or binary.

When creating a consumer using the `/consumers/groupid` endpoint, the `POST` request body must specify an embedded data format of either JSON or binary. This is specified in the `format` field in the request body, for example:

[source,json,subs=attributes+]
----
{
  "name": "my-consumer",
  "format": "binary", <1>
...
}
----

<1> A binary embedded data format.

If an embedded data format for the consumer is not specified, then a binary format is set.

The embedded data format specified when creating a consumer must match the data format of the Kafka messages it will consume. 

If you choose to specify a binary embedded data format, subsequent producer requests must provide the binary data in the request body as Base64-encoded strings. For example, when sending messages by making `POST` requests to the `/topics/_topicname_` endpoint, the `value` must be encoded in Base64:

[source,json,subs=attributes+]
----
{
  "records": [
    {
      "key": "my-key",
      "value": "ZWR3YXJkdGhldGhyZWVsZWdnZWRjYXQ="
    },
  ]
}
----

Producer requests must also provide a `Content-Type` header that corresponds to the embedded data format, for example, `Content-Type: application/vnd.kafka.binary.v2+json`.

=== Accept headers

After creating a consumer, all subsequent GET requests must provide an `Accept` header in the following format:

[source,http,subs=+quotes]
----
Accept: application/vnd.kafka._embedded-data-format_.v2+json
----

The __embedded-data-format__ is either `json` or `binary`.

For example, when retrieving records for a subscribed consumer using an embedded data format of JSON, include this Accept header:

[source,http,subs=+quotes]
----
Accept: application/vnd.kafka.json.v2+json
----
