This guide describes how to install and configure Apache Zookeeper and Apache Kafka
as non-containerized workloads on bare-metal or virtual machines.

== Overview

Apache Kafka is a platform for streaming data delivery and processing. It consists from 4 main components:

Kafka Broker:: Messaging broker responsible for delivering records from producing clients to consuming clients.
Kafka Connect:: A toolkit for streaming data between Kafka brokers and other systems using _Connector_ plugins.
Kafka Consumer and Producer APIs:: Java based APIs for producing and consuming messages to / from Kafka brokers.
Kafka Streams API:: API for writting _stream processor_ applications.

Kafka Broker is the central point connecting all these components. The broker itself uses Apache Zookeeper for
storing configuration data and for cluster coordination (electing leaders, etc.). Before installing Apache Kafka, an Apache
Zookeeper cluster has to be ready.
