= Overview of distributed tracing

Distributed tracing allows developers and system administrators to track the progress of transactions between applications (and services in a microservice architecture) in a distributed system. This information is useful for monitoring application performance and investigating issues with target systems and end-user applications.

In {ProductName}, distributed tracing facilitates the end-to-end tracking of messages: from source systems to the Kafka cluster and then to target systems and applications.

As an aspect of system observability, distributed tracing complements the metrics that are available to view in xref:con-metrics-kafka-exporter-grafana-{context}[Grafana] dashboards and the available loggers for each component.

== OpenTracing and Jaeger

The {OpenTracingHome} and {JaegerHome} projects are used to implement distributed tracing in {ProductName}.

.OpenTracing

The OpenTracing specification defines APIs that developers can use to instrument applications for distributed tracing. When you instrument an application, you add instrumentation code in order to monitor the execution of individual transactions. When instrumented, applications generate __traces__ when individual transactions occur. Traces are composed of __spans__, which define specific units of work.

To simplify the instrumentation of Kafka clients, {ProductName} includes the https://github.com/opentracing-contrib/java-kafka-client/blob/master/README.md[OpenTracing Apache Kafka Client Instrumentation^] library.

NOTE: The OpenTracing project is merging with the OpenCensus project to form the {OpenTelemetryHome} project. OpenTelemetry will provide compatibility for applications that are instrumented using the OpenTracing APIs.

.Jaeger

Jaeger, a tracing system, is an implementation of the OpenTracing APIs. Jaeger is used for monitoring and troubleshooting microservices-based distributed systems and provides client libraries for instrumenting applications.

Jaeger samples the total traces generated by an application, based on a set sampling strategy, and then visualizes them in a user interface. This allows you to visualize, query, filter, and analyze trace data.
