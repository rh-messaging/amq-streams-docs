= Overview of distributed tracing in {ProductName}

Distributed tracing allows developers and system administrators to track the progress of transactions between applications (and services in a microservice architecture) in a distributed system. This information is useful for monitoring application performance and investigating issues with target systems and end-user applications.

In {ProductName}, distributed tracing facilitates the end-to-end tracking of messages: from source systems to the Kafka cluster and then to target systems and applications.

As an aspect of system observability, distributed tracing complements the metrics that are available to view in xref:con-metrics-kafka-exporter-grafana-{context}[Grafana] dashboards and the available loggers for each component.

Distributed tracing in {ProductName} is implemented using the open source {OpenTracingHome} and {JaegerHome} projects.

.OpenTracing overview

The OpenTracing specification defines APIs that developers can use to instrument applications for distributed tracing. It is independent from the tracing system.

When instrumented, applications generate __traces__ for individual transactions. Traces are composed of __spans__, which define specific units of work.

To simplify the instrumentation of Kafka Producer, Consumer, and Streams API applications, {ProductName} includes the https://github.com/opentracing-contrib/java-kafka-client/blob/master/README.md[OpenTracing Apache Kafka Client Instrumentation^] library.

NOTE: The OpenTracing project is merging with the OpenCensus project. The new, combined project is named {OpenTelemetryHome}. OpenTelemetry will provide compatibility for applications that are instrumented using the OpenTracing APIs.

.Jaeger overview

Jaeger, a tracing system, is an implementation of the OpenTracing APIs used for monitoring and troubleshooting microservices-based distributed systems. It consists of four main components and provides client libraries for instrumenting applications. You can use the Jaeger user interface to visualize, query, filter, and analyze trace data.

== Distributed tracing support in {ProductName}

In {ProductName} on {ProductPlatformName}, distributed tracing is supported in the following Kafka clients and components:

* Kafka Producers
* Kafka Consumers
* Kafka Streams API applications
* Kafka Connect
* Mirror Maker 

To enable distributed tracing in these clients and components, you instrument application code using the OpenTracing Apache Kafka Client Instrumentation library.
When instrumented, these clients generate traces for messages (for example, when producing messages or writing offsets to the log).

Traces are sampled according to a sampling strategy and then visualized in the Jaeger user interface. This trace data is useful for monitoring the performance of your Kafka cluster and debugging issues with target systems and applications.
