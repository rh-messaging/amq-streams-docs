= Enabling tracing for the Kafka Bridge

Enable distributed tracing for the Kafka Bridge by editing the Kafka Bridge configuration file. You can then deploy a Kafka Bridge instance that is configured for distributed tracing to the host operating system.

Traces are generated for the following transactions:

* The Kafka Bridge sends messages to HTTP clients and consumes messages from HTTP clients.

* HTTP clients send HTTP requests to send and receive messages through the Kafka Bridge.

In order to have end-to-end tracing, you must also configure tracing in your HTTP clients.

.Procedure

. Edit the `config/application.properties` file in the Kafka Bridge installation directory.
+
Remove the code comments from the following line:
+
[source,properties,subs="attributes+"]
----
bridge.tracing=jaeger
----

. Save the configuration file.

. Run the `bin/kafka_bridge_run.sh` script using the configuration properties as a parameter:
+
[source,shell,%hardbreaks,subs="attributes+"]
----
cd kafka-bridge-0.xy.x.redhat-0000x
./bin/kafka_bridge_run.sh --config-file=config/application.properties
----

The Interceptors in the Kafka Bridge's internal consumers and producers are now enabled.
