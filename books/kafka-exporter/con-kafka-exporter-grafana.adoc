= Presenting Kafka Exporter metrics in Grafana

Using Kafka Exporter Prometheus metrics as a data source, you can create a dashboard of Grafana charts.

For example, from the metrics you can create the following Grafana charts:

* Message in per second (from topics)
* Message in per minute (from topics)
* Lag by consumer group
* Messages consumed per minute (by consumer groups)

When metrics data has been collected for some time, the Kafka Exporter charts are populated.

Use the Grafana charts to analyze lag and to check if actions to reduce lag are having an impact on an affected consumer group.
If, for example, Kafka brokers are adjusted to reduce lag, the dashboard will show the  _Lag by consumer group_ chart going down and the _Messages consumed per minute_ chart going up.
