= Upgrading an {ProductName} cluster from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0

This chapter describes how to upgrade {ProductName} on Red Hat Enterprise Linux from version 1.0 to version 1.1.0. No cluster downtime is required.

{ProductName} 1.0 and 1.1.0 are based on different versions of Apache Kafka:

[options="header"]
|=======================
|{ProductName} version |Kafka version 
|1.0                   |2.0.0         
|1.1.0                 |2.1.1         
|=======================

Although {ProductName} 1.1.0 and Kafka 2.1.1 are both minor releases, the Kafka protocol has changed since Kafka 2.0.0 was released. In particular, the message format version and inter-broker protocol version are both now at version 2.1. As a result, the upgrade process involves making both configuration changes to existing Kafka brokers and code changes to client applications (consumers and producers). The following table shows the differences between the two Kafka versions:

[options="header"]
|=======================
|Kafka version |Inter-broker protocol version |Log message format version |Zookeeper version
|2.0.0         |2.0                           |2.0                        |3.4.13
|2.1.1         |2.1                           |2.1                        |3.4.13
|=======================

Although Kafka 2.0.0 and 2.1.1 use the same version of Zookeeper, Red Hat recommends that you update your Zookeeper cluster to use the newest Zookeeper binaries before proceeding with the main {ProductName} 1.1.0 upgrade.

In summary, upgrading to {ProductName} 1.1.0 is a four-stage process:

. First, you update your Zookeeper cluster to use the newest Zookeeper binaries.

.. xref:proc-updating-zookeeper-binaries-{context}[Updating the Zookeeper binaries]

. Second, you update all Kafka brokers to use the previous protocol versions.
.. xref:proc-updating-kafka-brokers-to-previous-protocol-versions-{context}[Updating Kafka brokers to the previous protocol versions] (version 2.0)

. Third, you upgrade all Kafka brokers to {ProductName} 1.1.0. 
.. xref:proc-upgrading-kafka-brokers-to-amq-streams-1-1-0-{context}[Upgrading Kafka brokers to {ProductName} 1.1.0]

. Finally, you upgrade all Kafka brokers and client applications to Kafka 2.1.1. To avoid cluster downtime, this stage involves three related procedures:

.. xref:proc-updating-kafka-brokers-to-new-inter-broker-protocol-version-{context}[Updating Kafka brokers to the new inter-broker protocol version] (version 2.1)

.. xref:proc-upgrading-clients-to-new-kafka-version-{context}[Upgrading client applications to the new Kafka version]

.. xref:proc-updating-kafka-brokers-to-new-message-format-version-{context}[Updating Kafka brokers to the new message format version] (version 2.1)

Red Hat recommends that you complete the upgrade procedures in the order shown.

.Prerequisites

Before you begin these procedures, make sure that:

* {ProductName} 1.0 is installed. For instructions, see xref:proc-installing-amq-streams-{context}[Installing {ProductName}].

* You have read the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.2/html-single/amq_streams_1.1.0_on_red_hat_enterprise_linux_rhel_release_notes[{ProductName} 1.1.0 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux Release Notes].
