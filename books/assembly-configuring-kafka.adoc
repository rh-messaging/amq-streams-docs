= Configuring Kafka

Kafka uses a properties file to store static configuration.
The recommended location for the configuration file is `/opt/kafka/config/server.properties`.
The configuration file has to be readable by the `kafka` user.

AMQ Streams ships an example configuration file that highlights various basic and advanced features of the product.
It can be found under `config/server.properties` in the AMQ Streams installation directory.

This chapter explains the most important configuration options.
For a complete list of supported Kafka broker configuration options, see xref:broker-configuration-parameters-{context}[].
