= Configuring Red Hat Single Sign-On as an {oauth} authorization server

This procedure describes how to deploy Red Hat Single Sign-On as an authorization server and configure it for integration with {ProductName}.

The authorization server provides a central point for authentication and authorization, and management of users, clients, and permissions.
Red Hat Single Sign-On has a concept of realms where a _realm_ represents a separate set of users, clients, permissions, and other configuration.
You can use a default _master realm_, or create a new one.
Each realm exposes its own {oauth} endpoints, which means that application clients and application servers all need to use the same realm.

To use {oauth} with {ProductName}, you need a deployment of an authorization server to be able to create and manage authentication realms.

NOTE: If you already have Red Hat Single Sign-On deployed, you can skip the deployment step and use your current deployment.

.Before you begin

You will need to be familiar with using Red Hat Single Sign-On.

For installation and administration instructions, see:

* {sso-install-doc}
* {sso-admin-doc}

.Prerequisites

* {ProductName} and Kafka are running

For the Red Hat Single Sign-On deployment:

* Check the {sso-config}

.Procedure

. Install Red Hat Single Sign-On.
+
You can install from a ZIP file or by using an RPM.

. Log in to the Red Hat Single Sign-On Admin Console to create the {oauth} policies for {ProductName}.
+
Login details are provided when you deploy Red Hat Single Sign-On.

. Create and enable a realm.
+
You can use an existing master realm.

. Adjust the session and token timeouts for the realm, if required.

. Create a client called `kafka-broker`.

. From the menu:Settings[] tab, set:
+
* *Access Type* to `Confidential`
* *Standard Flow Enabled* to `OFF` to disable web login for this client
* *Service Accounts Enabled* to `ON` to allow this client to authenticate in its own name

. Click *Save* before continuing.

. From the menu:Credentials[] tab, take a note of the secret for using in your {ProductName} Kafka cluster configuration.

. Repeat the client creation steps for any application client that will connect to your Kafka brokers.
+
Create a definition for each new client.
+
You will use the names as client IDs in your configuration.

.What to do next
After deploying and configuring the authorization server, xref:proc-oauth-broker-config-{context}[configure the Kafka brokers to use {oauth}].
