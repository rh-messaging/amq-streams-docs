= {oauth} authentication mechanism

Support for {oauth} is based on the Kafka _SASL OAUTHBEARER_ mechanism, which is used to establish authenticated sessions with a Kafka broker.

A Kafka client initiates a session with the Kafka broker using the _SASL OAUTHBEARER_ mechanism for credentials exchange, where credentials take the form of an access token.

Kafka brokers and clients need to be configured to use {oauth}.

.Kafka broker configuration
The Kafka broker must be configured to validate the token received during session initiation.
The recommended approach is to create a _client_ definition in an authorization server with:

* Client ID of `kafka-broker`
* Client ID and secret as the authentication mechanism

.Kafka client configuration
A Kafka client is configured with either:

* Credentials required to obtain a valid access token from an authorization server
* A valid long-lived access token, obtained using tools provided by an authorization server

Credentials are never sent to the Kafka broker.
The only information ever sent to the Kafka broker is an access token.
When a client obtains an access token, no further communication with the authorization server is needed.

The simplest mechanism, which requires no additional usage of authorization server tools, is authentication with a client ID and secret.
Using a long-lived access token, or a long-lived refresh token, is more complex.

NOTE: If you are using long-lived access tokens, you can set policy in the authorization server to increase the maximum lifetime of the token.

If the Kafka client is not configured with an access token directly, the client exchanges credentials for an access token during Kafka session initiation by contacting the authorization server.
The Kafka client uses one of two mechanisms:

* Client id and secret
* Client id, refresh token, and (optionally) a secret
