= Kafka Exporter

{kafka-exporter-project} is an open source project to enhance monitoring of Apache Kafka brokers and clients.

Kafka Exporter is provided with {ProductName} for deployment with a Kafka cluster to extract additional metrics data from Kafka brokers related to offsets, consumer groups, consumer lag, and topics.

The metrics data is used, for example, to help identify slow consumers.

Lag data is exposed as Prometheus metrics, which can then be presented in Grafana for analysis.

If you are already using Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring of built-in Kafka metrics, you can configure Prometheus to also scrape the Kafka Exporter Prometheus endpoint.

.Additional resources

Kafka exposes metrics through JMX, which can then be exported as Prometheus metrics.
