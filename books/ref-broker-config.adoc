= Broker configuration parameters

`zookeeper.connect`::
*Type:* string +
*Importance:* high +
*Dynamic update:* read-only +
+
Specifies the ZooKeeper connection string in the form `hostname:port` where host and port are the host and port of a ZooKeeper server. To allow connecting through other ZooKeeper nodes when that ZooKeeper machine is down you can also specify multiple hosts in the form `hostname1:port1,hostname2:port2,hostname3:port3`.
The server can also have a ZooKeeper chroot path as part of its ZooKeeper connection string which puts its data under some path in the global ZooKeeper namespace. For example to give a chroot path of `/chroot/path` you would give the connection string as `hostname1:port1,hostname2:port2,hostname3:port3/chroot/path`.

`advertised.host.name`::
*Type:* string +
*Default:* null +
*Importance:* high +
*Dynamic update:* read-only +
+
DEPRECATED: only used when `advertised.listeners` or `listeners` are not set. Use `advertised.listeners` instead. 
Hostname to publish to ZooKeeper for clients to use. In IaaS environments, this may need to be different from the interface to which the broker binds. If this is not set, it will use the value for `host.name` if configured. Otherwise it will use the value returned from java.net.InetAddress.getCanonicalHostName().

`advertised.listeners`::
*Type:* string +
*Default:* null +
*Importance:* high +
*Dynamic update:* per-broker +
+
Listeners to publish to ZooKeeper for clients to use, if different than the `listeners` config property. In IaaS environments, this may need to be different from the interface to which the broker binds. If this is not set, the value for `listeners` will be used. Unlike `listeners` it is not valid to advertise the 0.0.0.0 meta-address.

`advertised.port`::
*Type:* int +
*Default:* null +
*Importance:* high +
*Dynamic update:* read-only +
+
DEPRECATED: only used when `advertised.listeners` or `listeners` are not set. Use `advertised.listeners` instead. 
The port to publish to ZooKeeper for clients to use. In IaaS environments, this may need to be different from the port to which the broker binds. If this is not set, it will publish the same port that the broker binds to.

`auto.create.topics.enable`::
*Type:* boolean +
*Default:* true +
*Importance:* high +
*Dynamic update:* read-only +
+
Enable auto creation of topic on the server.

*Type:* int +
*Default:* -1 +
*Importance:* high +
*Dynamic update:* read-only +
+
The broker id for this server. If unset, a unique broker id will be generated.To avoid conflicts between zookeeper generated broker id's and user configured broker id's, generated broker ids start from reserved.broker.max.id + 1.

`compression.type`::
*Type:* string +
*Default:* producer +
*Importance:* high +
*Dynamic update:* cluster-wide +
+
Specify the final compression type for a given topic. This configuration accepts the standard compression codecs ('gzip', 'snappy', 'lz4', 'zstd'). It additionally accepts 'uncompressed' which is equivalent to no compression; and 'producer' which means retain the original compression codec set by the producer.

`control.plane.listener.name`::
*Type:* string +
*Default:* null +
*Importance:* high +
*Dynamic update:* read-only +
+
Name of listener used for communication between controller and brokers. Broker will use the control.plane.listener.name to locate the endpoint in listeners list, to listen for connections from the controller. For example, if a broker's config is :
listeners = INTERNAL://192.1.1.8:9092, EXTERNAL://10.1.1.5:9093, CONTROLLER://192.1.1.8:9094
listener.security.protocol.map = INTERNAL:PLAINTEXT, EXTERNAL:SSL, CONTROLLER:SSL
control.plane.listener.name = CONTROLLER
On startup, the broker will start listening on "192.1.1.8:9094" with security protocol "SSL".
On controller side, when it discovers a broker's published endpoints through zookeeper, it will use the control.plane.listener.name to find the endpoint, which it will use to establish connection to the broker.
For example, if the broker's published endpoints on zookeeper are :
"endpoints" : ["INTERNAL://broker1.example.com:9092","EXTERNAL://broker1.example.com:9093","CONTROLLER://broker1.example.com:9094"]
 and the controller's config is :
listener.security.protocol.map = INTERNAL:PLAINTEXT, EXTERNAL:SSL, CONTROLLER:SSL
control.plane.listener.name = CONTROLLER
then controller will use "broker1.example.com:9094" with security protocol "SSL" to connect to the broker.
If not explicitly configured, the default value will be null and there will be no dedicated endpoints for controller connections.

`delete.topic.enable`::
*Type:* boolean +
*Default:* true +
*Importance:* high +
*Dynamic update:* read-only +
+
Enables delete topic. Delete topic through the admin tool will have no effect if this config is turned off.

`min.insync.replicas`::
*Type:* int +
*Default:* 1 +
*Valid Values:* [1,...] +
*Importance:* high +

If this minimum cannot be met, then the producer will raise an exception (either NotEnoughReplicas or NotEnoughReplicasAfterAppend).
When used together, min.insync.replicas and acks allow you to enforce greater durability guarantees. A typical scenario would be to create a topic with a replication factor of 3, set min.insync.replicas to 2, and produce with acks of "all". This will ensure that the producer raises an exception if a majority of replicas do not receive a write.

The token has a maximum lifetime beyond which it cannot be renewed anymore. Default value 7 days.

`delete.records.purgatory.purge.interval.requests`::
*Type:* int +
*Default:* 1 +
*Importance:* medium +
*Dynamic update:* read-only +
+
The purge interval (in number of requests) of the delete records request purgatory.

`fetch.purgatory.purge.interval.requests`::
*Type:* int +

`group.initial.rebalance.delay.ms`::
*Type:* int +
*Default:* 3000 +
*Importance:* medium +
*Dynamic update:* read-only +
+
The amount of time the group coordinator will wait for more consumers to join a new group before performing the first rebalance. A longer delay means potentially fewer rebalances, but increases the time until processing begins.

`group.max.session.timeout.ms`::
*Type:* int +
*Default:* 1800000 +
*Importance:* medium +
*Dynamic update:* read-only +
+
The maximum allowed session timeout for registered consumers. Longer timeouts give consumers more time to process messages in between heartbeats at the cost of a longer time to detect failures.

`group.max.size`::
*Type:* int +
*Default:* 2147483647 +
*Valid Values:* [1,...] +
*Importance:* medium +
*Dynamic update:* read-only +
+
The maximum number of consumers that a single consumer group can accommodate.

`group.min.session.timeout.ms`::
*Type:* int +
*Default:* 6000 +
*Importance:* medium +
*Dynamic update:* read-only +
+
The minimum allowed session timeout for registered consumers. Shorter timeouts result in quicker failure detection at the cost of more frequent consumer heartbeating, which can overwhelm broker resources.

`inter.broker.listener.name`::
*Type:* string +
*Default:* null +
*Importance:* medium +
*Dynamic update:* read-only +
+
Name of listener used for communication between brokers. If this is unset, the listener name is defined by security.inter.broker.protocol. It is an error to set this and security.inter.broker.protocol properties at the same time.
