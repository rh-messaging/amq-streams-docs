= Creating connectors

This procedure will show you how to create a connector on Kafka Connect running in distributed mode.

.Prerequisites

* Kafka Connect is xref:proc-running-kafka-connect-distributed-{context}[running in distributed mode].

.Creating connectors

. Prepare a JSON payload with a connector configuration.
For example:
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "name": "my-connector",
  "config": {
    "connector.class": "org.apache.kafka.connect.file.FileStreamSinkConnector",
    "tasks.max": "1",
    "topics": "my-topic-1,my-topic-2",
    "file": "/tmp/output-file.txt"
  }
}
----

. Create the connector by sending a `POST` request to the `_<KafkaConnectAddress>_:8083/connectors`.
The following example shows how to do it using the `curl` utility:
+
[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
----
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data @sink-connector.json http://connect0.my-domain.com:8083/connectors
----

. Verify that connector has been deployed by sending a `GET` request to `_<KafkaConnectAddress>_:8083/connectors`.
The following example shows how to do it using the `curl` utility:
+
[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
----
curl http://connect0.my-domain.com:8083/connectors
