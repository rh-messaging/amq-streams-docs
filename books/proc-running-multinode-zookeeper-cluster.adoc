= Running multi-node Zookeeper cluster

This procedure will show you how to configure and run Zookeeper as a multi-node cluster.

.Prerequisites

* AMQ Streams is installed on all hosts which will be used as Zookeeper cluster nodes.

.Running the cluster

. Create the `myid` file in `/var/lib/zookeeper/`.
Enter ID `1` for the first Zookeeper node, `2` for the second Zookeeper node, and so on.
+
----
su - kafka
echo "_<NodeID>_" > /var/lib/zookeeper/myid
----
+
For example:
+
----
su - kafka
echo "1" > /var/lib/zookeeper/myid
----

. Edit the Zookeeper `/opt/kafka/config/zookeeper.properties` configuration file for the following:
+
* Set the option `dataDir` to `/var/lib/zookeeper/`.
+ Configure the `initLimit` and `syncLimit` options.
* Add a list of all Zookeeper nodes.
The list should include also the current node.
+
.Example configuration for a node of Zookeeper cluster with five members
[source,ini]
----
timeTick=2000
dataDir=/var/lib/zookeeper/
clientPort=2181
initLimit=5
syncLimit=2

server.1=172.17.0.1:2888:3888
server.2=172.17.0.2:2888:3888
server.3=172.17.0.3:2888:3888
server.4=172.17.0.4:2888:3888
server.5=172.17.0.5:2888:3888
----

. Start Zookeeper with the default configuration file.
+
[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
----
su - kafka
/opt/kafka/bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh -daemon /opt/kafka/config/zookeeper.properties
----

. Verify that the Zookeeper is running.
+
[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
----
jcmd | grep zookeeper
----

. Repeat this procedure on all the nodes of the cluster.

. Once all nodes of the clusters are up and running, verify that all nodes are members of the cluster by sending a `stat` command to each of the nodes using `ncat` utility.
+
.Use ncat stat to check the node status
[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
----
echo stat | ncat localhost 2181
----
+
In the output you should see information that the node is either `leader` or `follower`.
+
