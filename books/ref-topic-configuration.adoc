= Topic configuration

Auto-created topics will use the default topic configuration which can be specified in the broker properties file.
However, when creating topics manually, their configuration can be specified at creation time.
It is also possible to change a topic's configuration after it has been created.
The main topic configuration options for manually created topics are:

`cleanup.policy`::
Configures the retention policy to `delete` or `compact`.
The `delete` policy will delete old records. 
The `compact` policy will enable log compaction.
The default value is `delete`.
For more information about log compaction, see link:http://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#compaction[Kafka website^].

`compression.type`::
Specifies the compression which is used for stored messages.
Valid values are `gzip`, `snappy`, `lz4`, `uncompressed` (no compression) and `producer` (retain the compression codec used by the producer).
The default value is `producer`.

`max.message.bytes`::
The maximum size of a batch of messages allowed by the Kafka broker, in bytes.
The default value is `1000012`.

`min.insync.replicas`::
The minimum number of replicas which must be in sync for a write to be considered successful.
The default value is `1`.

`retention.ms`::
Maximum number of milliseconds for which log segments will be retained.
Log segments older than this value will be deleted.
The default value is `604800000` (7 days).

`retention.bytes`::
The maximum number of bytes a partition will retain.
Once the partition size grows over this limit, the oldest log segments will be deleted.
Value of `-1` indicates no limit.
The default value is `-1`.

`segment.bytes`::
The maximum file size of a single commit log segment file in bytes.
When the segment reaches its size, a new segment will be started.
The default value is `1073741824` bytes (1 gibibyte).

The defaults for auto-created topics can be specified in the Kafka broker configuration using similar options:

`log.cleanup.policy`:: See `cleanup.policy` above.
`compression.type`:: See `compression.type` above.
`message.max.bytes`:: See `max.message.bytes` above.
`min.insync.replicas`:: See `min.insync.replicas` above.
`log.retention.ms`:: See `retention.ms` above.
`log.retention.bytes`:: See `retention.bytes` above.
`log.segment.bytes`:: See `segment.bytes` above.
`default.replication.factor`:: Default replication factor for automatically created topics.
Default value is `1`.
`num.partitions`:: Default number of partitions for automatically created topics.
Default value is `1`.
