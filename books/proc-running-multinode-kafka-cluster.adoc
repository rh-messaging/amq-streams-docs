= Running a multi-node Kafka cluster

This procedure will show you how to configure and run Kafka as a multi-node cluster.

.Prerequisites

* AMQ Streams is xref:proc-installing-amq-streams-{context}[installed] on all hosts which will be used as Kafka brokers.
* Zookeeper cluster is xref:proc-running-multinode-zookeeper-cluster-{context}[configured and running].

.Running the cluster

. Edit the `/opt/kafka/config/server.properties` Kafka configuration file for the following:
+
* Set the `broker.id` field to `0` for the first broker, `1` for the second broker, and so on.
+ Configure the details for connecting to Zookeeper in the `zookeeper.connect` option.
+ Configure the Kafka listeners.
+ Set the directories where the commit logs should be stored in the `logs.dir` directory.
+
The following example shows the configuration for a Kafka broker:
+
[source,ini]
----
broker.id=0
zookeeper.connect=zoo1.my-domain.com:2181,zoo2.my-domain.com:2181,zoo3.my-domain.com:2181
listeners=REPLICATION://:9091,PLAINTEXT://:9092
inter.broker.listener.name=REPLICATION
log.dirs=/var/lib/zookeeper
----
+
In a typical installation where each Kafka broker is running on identical hardware, only the `broker.id` configuration property will differ between each broker config.

. Start the Kafka broker with the default configuration file.
+
[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
----
su - kafka
/opt/kafka/bin/kafka-server-start.sh -daemon /opt/kafka/config/server.properties
----

. Verify that the Kafka broker is running.
+
[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
----
jcmd | grep Kafka
----

. Repeat this procedure on all the nodes of the Kafka cluster.

. Once all nodes of the clusters are up and running, verify that all nodes are members of the Kafka cluster by sending a `dump` command to one of the Zookeeper nodes using the `ncat` utility.
The command will print all Kafka brokers registered in Zookeeper.
+
.Use ncat stat to check the node status
[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
----
echo dump | ncat zoo1.my-domain.com 2181
----
+
The output should contain all Kafka brokers you just configured and started.
+
.Example output from the `ncat` command for Kafka cluster with 3 nodes
[source,plain,subs=+quotes]
----
SessionTracker dump:

ephemeral nodes dump:
