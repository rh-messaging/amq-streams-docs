= Topic configuration parameters

`cleanup.policy`::
*Type:* list +
*Default:* delete +
*Valid Values:* [compact, delete] +
*Server Default Property:* log.cleanup.policy +
*Importance:* medium +
+
A string that is either "delete" or "compact" or both. This string designates the retention policy to use on old log segments. The default policy ("delete") will discard old segments when their retention time or size limit has been reached. The "compact" setting will enable https://kafka.apache.org/23/documentation.html#compaction[log compaction] on the topic.

`compression.type`::
*Type:* string +
*Default:* producer +
*Valid Values:* [uncompressed, zstd, lz4, snappy, gzip, producer] +
*Server Default Property:* compression.type +
*Importance:* medium +
+
Specify the final compression type for a given topic. This configuration accepts the standard compression codecs ('gzip', 'snappy', 'lz4', 'zstd'). It additionally accepts 'uncompressed' which is equivalent to no compression; and 'producer' which means retain the original compression codec set by the producer.

`delete.retention.ms`::
*Type:* long +
*Default:* 86400000 +
*Valid Values:* [0,...] +
*Server Default Property:* log.cleaner.delete.retention.ms +
*Importance:* medium +
+
The amount of time to retain delete tombstone markers for https://kafka.apache.org/23/documentation.html#compaction[log compacted] topics. This setting also gives a bound on the time in which a consumer must complete a read if they begin from offset 0 to ensure that they get a valid snapshot of the final stage (otherwise delete tombstones may be collected before they complete their scan).

`file.delete.delay.ms`::
*Type:* long +
*Default:* 60000 +
*Valid Values:* [0,...] +
*Server Default Property:* log.segment.delete.delay.ms +
*Importance:* medium +
+
The time to wait before deleting a file from the filesystem.

`flush.messages`::
*Type:* long +
*Default:* 9223372036854775807 +
*Valid Values:* [0,...] +
*Server Default Property:* log.flush.interval.messages +
*Importance:* medium +
+
This setting allows specifying an interval at which we will force an fsync of data written to the log. For example if this was set to 1 we would fsync after every message; if it were 5 we would fsync after every five messages. In general we recommend you not set this and use replication for durability and allow the operating system's background flush capabilities as it is more efficient. This setting can be overridden on a per-topic basis (see https://kafka.apache.org/23/documentation.html#topicconfigs[the per-topic configuration section]).

`flush.ms`::
*Type:* long +
*Default:* 9223372036854775807 +
*Valid Values:* [0,...] +
*Server Default Property:* log.flush.interval.ms +
*Importance:* medium +
+
This setting allows specifying a time interval at which we will force an fsync of data written to the log. For example if this was set to 1000 we would fsync after 1000 ms had passed. In general we recommend you not set this and use replication for durability and allow the operating system's background flush capabilities as it is more efficient.
