= Authorization

Zookeeper supports access control lists (ACLs) to protect data stored inside it.
Kafka brokers can automatically configure the ACL rights for all Zookeeper records they create so no other Zookeeper user can modify them.

For more information about enabling Zookeeper ACLs in Kafka brokers, see xref:assembly-kafka-zookeeper-authorization-{context}[].
